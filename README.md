# Configuration files for Unix-like systems

This is a collection of configuration files I use on a daily basis.

My main intent here is _portability_; I use different Unix-like OSs: RedHat
Enterprise Linux at work, MacOS, OpenBSD and some Linux flavors at home;
of course, I like my apps behaving coherently wherever I run them.


# Installation
