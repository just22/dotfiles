# just22's dotfiles

This is my dotfiles repository, a collection of configuration files I use on a
daily basis.

My main concern here is portability; I use different Unix-like OSs: RedHat
Enterprise Linux at work, mostly OpenBSD and some Linux flavors at home;
of course, I like my apps behaving coherently wherever I run them.


# Installation
